## Decred Glossary

**Distributed ledger:** A ledger recording transactions between addresses, every node on the network holds a copy of the same ledger, commonly referred to as the "blockchain".

**Consensus rules:** There must be consensus between every node on the network about what the rules are, e.g. who can make new blocks, what can blocks contain and how should they be structured.

**Protocol rules:** See consensus rules.

**Block:** Transactions are written to the distributed ledger in blocks. Decred's difficulty adjusts such that new blocks are found every five minutes on average.

Wallet: 

**Seed:** A series of 33 words that is used to generate the private key for a wallet. Anyone who has the seed for a wallet can spend any DCR it holds.

**Private passphrase:** wallet.db files encrypted with a private passphrase cannot be used without that passphrase.

**Account:** A single Decred wallet can be used to operate multiple independent accounts (i.e. DCR transfers between accounts are on-chain transactions).
